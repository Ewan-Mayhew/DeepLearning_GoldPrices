Hi! This is a proof of concept for using deep learning transformer models to predict price data.

I have not uploaded my training data or unseen training data here, as the files are very large. The model can be trained on any 9 parameter input vector set.

A version of this was trained on CoreWeave Cloud GPUs, producing sub 0.005 MSE losses on unseen data after <500 training epochs.

Enjoy!
